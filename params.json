It is a feature-based method, implementing a combination of 3D Harris Corner Detectors for keypoints and a 3D-modification of SIFT by [Scovanner et al, 2012](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~pscovann/)\r\n\r\n [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pipeline has five primary components. First, the image volume is partitioned into 25 subvolumes for parallelization and robustness checking in later steps. Each subvolume then identifies distinguishable keypoints using a 3D Harris Corner Detector [3]  and uses a 3D modification of SIFT [4] to create a descriptor vector associated with the keypoint. The third step is that each subvolume of the experiment to be warped searches for corresponding keypoints in the appropriate subvolume in the reference experiment using the SIFT metric for measuring similarity between descriptors. The fourth step is that the keypoint correspondences are validated via calculating affine transformations of random subsets of 4 corresponding keypoints, and the number of inliers of the resulting transformation assessed by a pixel distance threshold of 1.5. Each time a pair of corresponding points is counted as an inlier, it receives a vote, and the correspondence pairs with at least 80% of the votes of the highest voted pair are kept as legitimate correspondences. Finally, the validated correspondences are used to calculate a thin plate spline  [5] for the entire volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\nIgnacio ","google":"UA-70830814-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
